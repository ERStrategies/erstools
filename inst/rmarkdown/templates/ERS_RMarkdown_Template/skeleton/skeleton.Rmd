## Part 0: Read Libraries and connect to Sharepoint

### 0.1 (OPTIONAL) Install the latest version of the erstools library!

**ACTION: Remove the "#"s and run the code below if you want to update the erstools package and get access to the newest ERS functions and the newest RMarkdown Template!**

**NOTE: To use the new RMarkdown template you need to close out of Rstudio and reopen it after running ers_update_erstools()**

```{r}
# library(devtools)
# library(erstools)
# ers_update_erstools()
```

### 0.2 Read All Libraries 

**ACTION: Run the code and read the comments for different functions you will have access to**

```{r, warning = F, message = F}
#ERS-specific functions!!
library(erstools) #includes functions like ers_read_sharepoint, ers_write_sharepoint, ers_table, and ers_column_info
#load data
library(Microsoft365R) # Use Microsoft365R to connect to SharePoint and load files
library(readxl) # Functions for reading Excel files: read_excel
library(openxlsx) # Functions for writing Excel files: write.xlsx
library(rmarkdown) # needed to create knitted files in output folder

#manipulate data
library(tidyverse) # Includes ggplot2, dplyr, tidyr, readr, etc.
library(data.table) # fread(): load large CSVs quickly
library(janitor) # Functions for cleaning and examining data: clean_names() instantly formats all column names
library(safejoin) # Provides safer join operations for 1:many matching - safe_left_join()
library(stringr) # str_detect(): pattern matching using regular expressions (see regex101.com)
#format and display data
library(scales) # Functions for scaling and formatting axes in plots: comma(), percent()
library(gt) # Creates and formats tables in a publication-ready format: gt()
library(flextable) # Creates and formats tables in a publication-ready format: flextable()
library(extrafont) # Manages and uses custom fonts in plots - loadfonts(): Loads fonts available on the system

```

Part 1: Bring in your data

### 1.0 Authenticate to sharepoint to be able to read in files

**ACTION: After running the code, look at your console code window below for instructions to log in. A window will probably open in your browser to ask you to log into Microsoft to confirm your identity**

```{r}
#set sharepoint site URL for access to our org-wide and external files
orgfiles_site_url <- "https://erstrategies1.sharepoint.com/sites/orgfiles"
#access sharepoint site URL you may be prompted to sign in here
orgfiles_site <- get_sharepoint_site(site_url = orgfiles_site_url)
```

### 1.1 Set your folder path(s)

**ACTION: Change the raw_data_folder_path to the path to your data. The folder path must start with either "District Partners" or "Internal". See the comments below for guidance on how to find the path**

**NOTE: If you don't want to type the name of your folder path, you can copy it directly from Sharepoint: https://app.tettra.co/teams/ersknowledge/pages/copying-a-folder-path-from-sharepoint-to-use-in-r**

```{r}
raw_data_folder_path <- "District Partners/Columbus City/22-23 Financial Equity & Funding System Design/1. Data & Analysis - Secure/Raw Data for R"
```

### 1.2 See guidance on using the "ers_read_sharepoint" function 

**ACTION: Run the code below to see documentation on our custom function!**

```{r}
?ers_read_sharepoint
```

### 1.3 Read in your data

**ACTION: Replace "raw_data" with the desired name of your data frame and replace "XXX.csv" with the file name.**

```{r}

raw_data <- ers_read_sharepoint(folder_path = raw_data_folder_path,
                    file_name_with_extension = "XXX.csv")
```

### 1.4 View your data

**ACTION: Replace "raw_data" with the same name of your data frame you used above, and run the code to inspect your data.**

```{r}
View(raw_data)
```

## Part 2: Validate Data

### 2.0 Check out the ers_column_info function as a starting place in your data validation (credits to Mauro!)

**ACTION: Run the code below to see documentation on our custom function!**

```{r}
#col_info function takes your data frame and outputs column information
#Example: ers_col_info(NCES_District_FY19)
?ers_column_info

```

### 2.1 Run ers_column_info on your data

**ACTION: Replace "raw_data" with the name of your data frame**

```{r}
ers_column_info(raw_data)
```

## Part 3: Process your data (more to come here later)

## Part 4: Analyze/view your data

### 4.0 Check out the ers_table function to make your tables nice using the gt package (credits to Mauro!)

**ACTION: Run the code below to see documentation on our custom function!**

```{r}
#turns your unpolished R tables into a table with nice formatting and a bolded table title
#Example: ers_table(dataset = NCES_District_FY19, title = "FY19 District Financials")
```


### 4.1 Run ers_table on your data

**ACTION: Replace "raw_data" with the name of your data frame and XXX with the desired title of your table**

```{r}
ers_table(dataset = raw_data, title = "XXX")
```

## Part 5: Upload File to Sharepoint

### 5.1 Set output data folder Path


**ACTION: Change the processed_data_folder_path to the path to your data. The folder path must start with either "District Partners" or "Internal". See the comments below for guidance on how to find the path**

```{r}
processed_data_folder_path <- "District Partners/Yakima"
```


### 5.2 See guidance on using the "ers_write_sharepoint" function 

**ACTION: Run the code below to see documentation on our custom function!**

```{r}
?ers_write_sharepoint
```

### 5.3 Write files

**ACTION: Replace "raw_data" with your desired name of your data and replace "XXX.csv" with the desired name of your output file.**

```{r}
#Example
ers_write_sharepoint(data = raw_data,
                     folder_path = processed_data_folder_path,
                     file_name_with_extension = "XXX.csv")
```

## Part 6: Knit the file

**ACTION: Use Ctrl+Shift+K to knit your file into a nicely formatted HTML/Word document that you can share with teammates!**
